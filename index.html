            <h3>ETM foundations for planning and quota design</h3>
            <p>
              ETM-driven hierarchy models create consistent territory and ownership views used by sales leadership for
              annual planning, quota setting, and headcount allocation decisions.

            <h3>Attainment and productivity for execution management</h3>
            <p>
              Trusted bookings, pipeline, and forecasting datasets combine leading pipeline health signals with
              lagging outcomes such as attainment, giving leadership a clear view to manage execution, identify risk,
              and prioritize interventions.

            <h3>Bookings and pipeline as a core data asset</h3>
            <p>
              A standardized bookings-and-pipeline table serves as a core data asset for multiple GTM teams,
              supporting planning, forecasting, performance reviews, and company-level reporting from the same
              trusted foundation.

        <h2>GTM Analytics Scope</h2>
        <p>
          A common analytics foundation across ETM and opportunity data gives sales leadership a consistent operating
          view across territory structure, coverage, pipeline quality, bookings performance, and rep execution. With
          shared metric definitions and trusted core datasets, planning and quota decisions become more repeatable,
          performance discussions become more objective, and strategic GTM decisions can be made with clearer
          trade-offs and stronger alignment across RevOps, Sales Ops, and field leadership.
